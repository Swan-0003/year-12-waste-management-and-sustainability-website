Website about wastemanagement and sustainability of busineses.

More info:
This is a website focused on educating New Zealanders in Auckland about proper waste management and sustainable food brands. 
My website directly addresses my inquiry questions and stakeholder perspectives (raising awareness). From my research it showed a lack of public awareness and is one of the biggest barriers to improving waste management, highlighted by the Ministry for the Environment and Localised.
By creating a free, easy to use, accessible, visually appealing website, I can provide clear information answering my inquiry question(s) on waste management, food sustainability, what waste is, how to manage waste, common mistakes when managing waste, and information on community/groups focused on zero waste.
I can highlight the organisations like Foodstuffs and Localised to increase awareness. The digital outcome informs my inquiry questions and also stakeholder perspectives.
